## Software packages

### RNA-seq
- [SCENIC](https://github.com/aertslab/SCENIC) - [R, Python] - SCENIC is a package to infer Gene Regulatory Networks and cell types from single-cell RNA-seq data. [SCENIC: single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4463)
- [SINCERITIES](https://github.com/CABSEL/SINCERITIES) - [R/Matlab] - [Inferring gene regulatory networks from time-stamped single cell transcriptional expression profiles](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/2/258/4158033)

### Perturb-seq
- [Normalisr](https://github.com/lingfeiwang/normalisr) - [Python, Shell] - Normalisr infers Gene Regulatory Networks from Perturb-seq and other single-cell CRISPR screens. Its normalization and statistical association testing framework also unifies single-cell differential expression and co-expression. [Single-cell normalization and association testing unifying CRISPR screen and gene co-expression analyses with Normalisr](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26682-1).

### Multi-omic
- [Dictys](https://github.com/pinellolab/dictys) - [Python] - Dictys reconstructs and analyzes context specific and dynamic Gene Regulatory Networks from scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets. [Dictys: dynamic gene regulatory network dissects developmental continuum with single-cell multi-omics](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.14.508036)
